## Available Standards

- `backend-style.md` – Django/DRF coding conventions, structure, linting.
- `frontend-style.md` – React/Vite standards, component patterns, security.
- `testing-policy.md` – unit/integration/e2e expectations and coverage targets.

2. Update the relevant markdown file and link it from this README.
3. Note enforcement mechanisms (lint rules, CI checks) once they exist.
