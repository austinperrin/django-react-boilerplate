# django-react-boilerplate

Enterprise-oriented mono-repo boilerplate for single-tenant SaaS deployments built with Django/DRF and React/Vite. The repo is currently in scaffolding mode; use `docs/index.md` for the canonical documentation tree and decisions.

## Getting Started

- Review `docs/index.md` for structure, conventions, and ADRs.
- Follow instructions in `infra/` (once populated) for local and production environments.
- Use `scripts/` for repeatable automation hooks as they are added.

## Status

This project is under initial setup. Expect documentation and code to evolve rapidly as conventions solidify.
